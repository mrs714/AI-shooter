Unity project to create and train an agent with a neural network using a genetic algorithm to do diverse tasks, like avoiding enemies or leading projectiles correctly.

Main Objectives
This project has been done with two main objectives in mind. The first was to get a more comprehensive look at some of Unity's features, such as instantiating prefabs, creating an intuitive Unity UI through sliders, selectors and such,
building robust, self-contained classes, with well-implemented OOP, delving into C# handling of private, protected, and public types among others...
The second, more important objective, was to build a neural network and implement a genetic algorithm by hand. While I had previously worked with intelligent agents, it was through the use of MLAgents during my research project. 
Now, having done the research, and having a deeper understanding of the nature of both NN and genetic algorithms, I wanted to build them from the ground up to strengthen my knowledge.
